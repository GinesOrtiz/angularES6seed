# angularES6seed
 An angularJS 1.5.x ES6 seed

******

This is a little bit more complex seed than an started pack one but I
will try my best to make the most detailed ```readme.md``` I ever done.

First things first. This seed is a grown up version based on all my own
experience using angularJS in different projects and companies. 
The base seed was: [angularjs-webpack-starter](https://github.com/dsebastien/angularjs-webpack-starter) by [@dsebastien](https://github.com/dsebastien)
